											<h3>About Me</h3>
										</header>
	<p>My name is Lauren, and I am a digital strategist who excels at project management, front-end development, digital marketing, and data analysis. Throughout my career, I have focused on boosting businesses that want to emphasize their strengths by reaching and engaging their targeted audiences.</p>
<p>At the onset of my career, I thought I might pursue life at the bench as a scientist, but I quickly found that my skills were better suited for the digital world, where I could utilize my creativity and problem-solving abilities. While working full-time, I joined several professional organizations in Washington, D.C. geared towards empowering women in technology. It was through these opportunities that I first realized my passion and inherent ability to build and design websites.</p>
<p>As I worked on my design and development skills, I realized I wanted to pursue more formal learning opportunities. So, I spent hours online learning web design best practices, later applying the skills to my first job, which involved user experience, digital marketing, and design strategy. During this position, I began to see how a website's design should support the goals of its user and the organization. Knowing this information allowed me to work closely with designers, developers, marketers, and business professionals to rapidly iterate the organization's design and development processes to best serve its users and advance the organization&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of years, I pressed myself to learn more about user experience and digital strategy and completed a Certificate in Digital Marketing from Georgetown University. There, I learned about brand identity, user experience, mobile and web design. The technical skills and marketing savvy needed to identify and engage users in today&rsquo;s changing digital environment led me to new professional experiences &ndash; including my current job &ndash; where I manage and optimize the website for a research institution whose primary focus is neuroscience and advanced imaging. Within this role, I actively work on the client side, assisting scientists in effectively communicating and promoting their science across a variety of digital platforms.</p>
<p>Most recently, I am working to complete my MS in Information Design &amp; Strategy, with an emphasis in Data Science and Analytics, from Northwestern University. In this program, I am keen to learn about additional opportunities to better translate information and data into meaningful visual forms, narratives, and interfaces. Further developing a deep and holistic understanding of today&rsquo;s sophisticated digital media and being able to translate raw data into actionable insights is imperative to establishing a larger impact on an organization's business strategy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a creative thinker with an in-depth knowledge of implementing, managing, and analyzing digital content to advance an organization&rsquo;s mission, best serve its users, and transform raw data into actionable insights. My ability to wear many hats&mdash;project manager, front-end developer, digital marketer, and data analyst&mdash;makes me a quadruple threat and an asset to any organization looking to make digital strategy the essence of their business strategy.</p>
<p>When I am not submerged in the digital realm, I can be found exploring Northern Virginia wineries with my husband or practicing barre moves with my two dogs, Penny and Lou Lou. Cheers to those who are always learning, trying, failing, dreaming big, being in the moment and above all else &ndash; staying humble, but tenacious.</p>
<p><strong>Feel free to check out some of my work and my inspiration blog, and if you are so inclined, get in touch. I am always open to and excited about opportunities to collaborate on new digital projects.</strong></p>
